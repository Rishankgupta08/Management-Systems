📂 Management Systems (Python | Console-Based)
This repository contains four simple and interactive console-based management systems implemented in Python. Each system is designed to be user-friendly, menu-driven, and runs entirely in-memory without the need for external file or database storage. These projects are perfect for learning core Python programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, user input handling, and control flow.
